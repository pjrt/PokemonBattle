PokemonBattle
=============

A random pokemon will be selected from an Resful API. `http://viclib.com/pokemon?query=`

That Pokemon will then attack you until you die. 

TODO:
============

* Accuracy should probably be implemented as pseudo-random. Pure random is too....random
* Code probably not up to standard.
