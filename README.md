PokemonBattle
=============

A random pokemon will be selected from an Resful API (which appears to no longer be online). `http://viclib.com/pokemon?query=`

That Pokemon will then attack you until you die.

TODO:
============

* Move to pokeapi.co: app doesn't work at the moment
* Accuracy should probably be implemented as pseudo-random. Pure random is too....random
* Code probably not up to standard.
