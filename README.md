PokemonBattle
=============

A random pokemon will be selected from an Resful API `www.pokeapi.co`

That Pokemon will, with four randomly selected moves, then attack you until you die.

TODO:
============

- [x] Move to pokeapi.co: <del>app doesn't work at the moment</del> (works now!)
- [x] Accuracy should probably be implemented as pseudo-random. Pure random is too....random
- [ ] Code probably not up to standard.
